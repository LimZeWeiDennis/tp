## Project: Warenager

Warenager is an **inventory application** to help tech-savvy warehouse managers to keep track of items in their warehouse.
It **optimizes management tasks** for warehouse managers including but not exhaustive of updating,
searching and ordering supplies, via Command Line Interface (CLI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find existing items in the storage.
  * What it does: Allows the user to search for desired stock.
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience as user can easily search for the details of
  existing items. Users can now search for their desired stocks quickly and conveniently,
  by using any of the fields (name, serial number, location stored, source of stock) to find
  their desired stock. Users have the convenience of searching for a whole list of stocks that are related,
  instead of only being able to search for one stock (via name).
  * Highlights: This enhancement comes with the ability to find stocks from not just the name of the stock
  but also other related fields such as serial number, location stored and source of stock.
  Search is also case-insensitive and any stock that contains the search term will be shown.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability for advanced find for existing items in the storage.
  * What it does: Allows the user to apply additional filters to search for desired stock.
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience as user can now accurately search
  for stocks using more filters, to narrow down the results.
  * Highlights: This enhancement comes with the ability to apply filters such as name of the stock,
  serial number, location stored and source of stock.
  Search is also case-insensitive and any stock that contains the search term will be shown.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add optional notes to existing items in the storage.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add notes to stock.
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience as user can now add optional notes
  to their stocks, to remind them of important details.
  * Highlights: This enhancement comes with the ability to add multiple notes to the stock.
  Users will be able to add notes to the stock at any time, without erasing their previous notes.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete one note or all notes from existing a stock in the storage.
  * What it does: Allows the user to delete notes from stock.
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience as user can now delete notes that they
  no longer need from the stock.
  * Highlights: This enhancement comes with the ability to delete one note from the stock by providing
  the index of note, or delete all notes from the stock.
  Users will be able to delete whichever note they want from the stock at any time,
  without needing to delete all notes.
